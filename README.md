This is the source code for the website and blog of Phil Lennon, a freelance Frontend and WordPress developer based in Manchester, UK.

This website has been made with [fedkit-assemble v0.6.1](https://github.com/PJL101/fedkit-assemble) and is automatically built and published with Travis CI (a blog post about this is coming ASAP). You can see the output of this in the GitHub hosted [website repository](https://github.com/PJL101/PJL101.github.io).

Currently this website is just a holding page with the 'proper' website and blog coming ASAP.

Please feel free to raise any issues, pull requests, comments etc. I am vey open to feedback, positive or negative!
